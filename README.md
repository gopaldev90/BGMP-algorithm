# Discovery:
lets talk about how idea came.
take any mersanne prime number.
let's say 31
now convert it to hex
hex of 31 -> 1f
now take next mersenne prime which is 127
hex of 127 -> 7f
next mersenne prime is 8191
hex of 8191 -> 1fff
can you ses pattern
yes. mersanne prime number is nothing but combination 1,7,f
we can create mersanne prime number by combining one prefix 1,6
and lot of f 
now we can check if generated number is prime or not 
if it is then you have got your mersenne prime number 

# BGMP-algorithm
BGMP stands for Bhole Gopal Mersanne Prime algorithm is very efficient for generating candidates for mersanne prime numbers
as we discussed above we can create algorithm 
we are using java
